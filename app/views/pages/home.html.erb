  <p>Proprietor Joe Viscomi opened Cappy’s Warehouse Wine & Spirits in July 2006, after amassing 40 years' experience in the retail wine & spirit business.  While still a teen, Joe began his career with future father-in-law Pete Capizzi at Henry Street Warehouse Liquors in Hempstead, NY.  In 1994, he established Wheatley Hills Discount Wine & Spirits in Westbury, NY, with sister-in-law, Roseann Kalb.  Each of these three family stores is independently owned and operated and is not part of a cooperative buying group.</p>
